The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, 
one of the best known in American history. 
It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War, 
on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, at the dedication of the Soldiers 
National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 
four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy 
at the Battle of Gettysburg. Four score and seven years ago our fathers 
brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, 
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, 
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate 
a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those 
who here gave their lives that that nation might live. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, 
we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, 
who struggled here, have consecrated it, 
far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, 
nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
